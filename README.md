# Symposium

## Description

Symposium is a sophisticated royalty-free music player that offers users access to a diverse collection of music, seamlessly blending technologies such as Node.js, Express, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Prisma, and MongoDB. This project is a prime example of the harmonious integration of these robust technologies to curate an immersive and user-friendly experience.

## How it Works

At the heart of Symposium is a server-side database full of royalty-free music, enabling users to browse and play their preferred songs directly within their web browser. The frontend, developed with React and TypeScript, and styled using Tailwind CSS, provides a sleek and intuitive interface for users to navigate through the extensive music library. Prisma, an innovative ORM, facilitates all interactions with the MongoDB database, ensuring that information about songs, albums, and artists is easily accessible.

Node.js and Express form the backbone of the backend, handling server-side logic and API requests that power the applicationâ€™s core functionality.
